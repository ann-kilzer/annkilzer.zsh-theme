# Ann's custom ZSH themes

Inspired by:
- https://github.com/greywillfade/productivity/blob/main/oh-my-zsh/sally.zsh-theme
- https://github.com/meiokubo/emoji.zsh-theme

You will need to use [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) to take advantage of the extended colors.

## dango.zsh-theme
pink-white-green üç°

## wormwood.zsh-theme
green üåø oh-my-zsh theme


## Installation

1. Use the script to copy the theme to the oh-my-zsh theme directory
```sh
./install.sh
```

2. Edit your `.zshrc` and set the theme to "wormwood" or "dango"

3. Run `source ~/.zshrc`
