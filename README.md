# Ann's custom ZSH themes

Inspired by:
- https://github.com/greywillfade/productivity/blob/main/oh-my-zsh/sally.zsh-theme
- https://github.com/meiokubo/emoji.zsh-theme

1. You will need to use [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) to take advantage of the extended colors.
2. These themes use a custom banner that says "HELLO ANN" and you'll have to do some editing if you want it to greet you by name, assuming your name is not Ann. Go here: http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/
